The assignment was to make an application related to spacial information to the Struve theme. The assignment was given by the Lapland University of Applied Sciences together with the National Land Survey of Finland.

It is an application designed to develop schoolchildren’s teamwork skills, teaching history and geography. The purpose of the device is to be a joint project of the class at school. The device comes from school, so it’s not unequal for schoolchildren. Intended for schoolchildren as a group to collect miles for a device that is run at school with the help of a teacher for the Struvy app. Students advance on the game through their real-life miles on an “African Star” type map. The application teaches schoolchildren the importance of the Struve chain and brings not only local knowledge but also knowledge of Finland and history.
